StyleSquared, or âˆšStyle, is a material & customizable calculator.

Despite the claim to customization and style, the calculator is still in a beta stage. 
Style will come soon, and customization will come soon after soon.

JFoenix & exp4j are currently required to run this. They will be added before the first beta jar release is done.
